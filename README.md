ShakeMusic
==========

We will develop an application called ‘Shake Music’ that will use accelerometer and maybe gyro sensors of the phone. It will have a nice UI, where users can choose between a variety of playing instruments, and while shaking their phone they will hear the sound and compose music. We haven’t yet decided about the number of playing instruments that will be included in the app, but this will be clearer in the final delivery of the assignment.  The application will be in three languages: English, Albanian and Spanish.
